# Speech Signal Processing in Python

This project is a Python-based interactive menu-driven application for recording, reading, and analyzing speech signals. It utilizes libraries such as `pyaudio`, `wave`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to perform operations like speech signal recording, visualization, and speech pattern generation.

## Features

1. **Record Speech Signal**
   - Records an audio signal and saves it as a `.wav` file.
2. **Read Recorded Speech Signal**
   - Reads the recorded signal, prints the audio data, and visualizes it as a waveform.
3. **Generate Speech Pattern**
   - Generates and displays the speech pattern using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
4. **Interactive Menu**
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for all operations.
